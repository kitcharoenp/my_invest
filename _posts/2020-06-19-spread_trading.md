# Spread Trading

A spread trade using futures is created by buying a futures contract and simultaneously selling another futures contract against it. These strategies are referred to as relative value strategies. [1][1]

The futures spread trade acts as a hedging transaction altering the traderâ€™s exposure from an outright price fluctuation, to the price differential between the individual legs of the spread trade. [1][1]

The profitability of a futures spread trade will depend of the price direction or differences in price movement for the legs of the strategy.[1][1]
