 [What is Divergence?][1]
> Divergence is when the price of an asset is `moving in the opposite direction` of a technical indicator, such as an oscillator, or is moving contrary to other data. Divergence warns that the `current price trend may be weakening`, and in some cases may lead to the price changing direction. Divergence can last a long time without a price reversal occurring. The trader can then determine if they want to exit the position or set a stop loss in case the price starts to decline. [[1]][1]

> If the price chart has formed another new high or low, and the indicator chart has failed to, it is a sign of divergence.[[2]][2]

 > Divergence (convergence) can be repeated several times in a row, while combining different classes and thus creating a stronger reversal model. Each class should be analyzed separately in each case. We can't say unambiguously which one is the strongest or the weakest one.[[2]][2]

### What Does Confirmation Mean?
>Confirmation refers to the use of an additional indicator or indicators to substantiate a trend suggested by one indicator.
>A trader often feels more secure deciding to act on a signal if more than one indicator is sending the same signal. If different indicators send conflicting signals, this is known as divergence.[[3]][3]
