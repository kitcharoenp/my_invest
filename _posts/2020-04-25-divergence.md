> [What is Divergence?][divergence]
Divergence is when the price of an asset is `moving in the opposite direction` of a technical indicator, such as an oscillator, or is moving contrary to other data. Divergence warns that the current price trend may be weakening, and in some cases may lead to the price changing direction.
