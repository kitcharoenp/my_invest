# Forex
The dollar dropped against a basket of other currencies for the second day on Tuesday as rising stocks reflected improving risk appetite, and as investors rebalanced portfolios for month-end.

Month-end rebalancing is also negative for the greenback with the U.S. dollar likely to be sold against the euro, sterling, the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, according to Mark McCormick, global head of FX strategy at TD Securities in Toronto. [[4]][4]

# Gold
Spot gold fell 1% to $1,710.71 per ounce, having earlier dropped as much as 1.3% to $1,704.45. U.S. gold futures settled 0.7% lower at 1,723.80.

“The impact from the shutdown is going to be felt for quite some time moving forward through macro data, and that will continue to support gold,” Patterson said, adding that a low interest rate environment would continue to benefit gold. [[3]][3]

On the technical front, bullion may fall to $1,677, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao. [[3]][3]
