* White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has clarified that the U.S.-China phase one trade deal is not over, and that his comments to Fox News was taken out of context. [2][2]


“It’s over,” Navarro told Fox News in an interview when asked about the trade agreement. He said the “turning point” came when the United States learned about the spreading coronavirus only after a Chinese delegation had left Washington following the signing of the Phase 1 deal on Jan. 15. [1][1]

“It was at a time when they had already sent hundreds of thousands of people to this country to spread that virus, and it was just minutes after wheels up when that plane took off that we began to hear about this pandemic,” Navarro said. [1][1]
