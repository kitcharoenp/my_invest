Failure to either pass another stopgap bill or override a possible Trump veto of the legislation could result in a partial government shutdown.

Irish Prime Minister Micheál Martin said he believed negotiators were more likely than not to strike a deal, but that talks may go beyond Dec. 25.

The UK wants to gradually curb EU access to its fishing waters over three years, while the bloc is proposing six years, to give its fishing industry longer to adjust.
