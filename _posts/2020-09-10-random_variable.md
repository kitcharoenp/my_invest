### [Key Takeaways][1]
*   A random variable is a variable whose value is unknown or a function that assigns values to each of an experiment's outcomes.
*   A random variable can be either discrete (having specific values) or continuous (any value in a continuous range).
*   The use of random variables is most common in probability and statistics, where they are used to quantify outcomes of random occurrences.
*   Risk analysts use random variables to estimate the probability of an adverse event occurring.


**Risk analysts** assign random variables to risk models when they want to estimate the probability of an [adverse event][2] occurring.

As a statistical tool, a frequency distribution provides a visual representation for the distribution of observations within a particular test.

### Types of Random Variables
A random variable can be either discrete or continuous.
*   **Discrete** random variables take on a countable number of distinct values.
*   **Continuous** random variables can represent any value within a specified range or interval and can take on an infinite number of possible values.
