Notes From My Reading [Guidelines for Applying Elliott Wave Theory](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_analysis:guidelines_for_applying_elliott_wave_theory)

### Scale
The Guideline of Scale is a technique of looking at the market and that is often applied when creating channel projections. It simply states that one should use both an arithmetic scale chart and a semi-log scale chart when looking at Elliott Waves. Arithmetic scale charts are good for looking at waves on lower degrees, but semi-log scale charts are good for bringing large trends (higher degrees) into perspective.
