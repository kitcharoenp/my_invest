# Key Points
* The Federal Reserve said Monday it will start buying individual corporate bonds. [1][1]
* Bloomberg reported that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration is preparing a $1 trillion infrastructure proposal.
* Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to testify before Congress on the central bank’s monetary policy maneuver


 Moving to a more aggressive bond-buying strategy “may also reflect the Committee’s view that the economic recovery from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis will be an extended and challenging one, with credit markets requiring extensive support,” Friedman added. [1][1]

 The Fed has been deploying historically aggressive policy moves over the past three months, and Monday’s action again raised fears of overreach as the central bank helps prop up a credit market laden with “zombie” companies whose revenues don’t cover their debt payments [1][1]

The Federal Reserve on Monday launched its **Main Street Lending Program**, the most complex program undertaken yet by the U.S. central bank to help keep the backbone of the economy from buckling under the strains of the coronavirus pandemic. [2][2]

The monthly report, due to be released by the Commerce Department on Tuesday, is expected to show overall receipts at U.S. retailers jumped 8.0% last month, according to a Reuters poll of economists. [3][3]
