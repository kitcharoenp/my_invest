## Macro
* Global real GDP is forecasted to grow by 2.2 percent in 2023, down from 3.2 percent in 2022.

* Japan has so far maintained looser
policy settings; but any shift away from its current
yield curve control could lead to unintended
consequences for the yen and potentially add
another layer of risk to the already elevated
levels of volatility in FX markets



### The U.S. economy: Looking beyond the cycle
* Our base case remains a hard landing. [Fidelity]

* While a 2023 recession is quite possible, it should
be a mild one if it occurs. More importantly, with inflation
continuing to fade and fiscal policy likely on hold

*  By 2024, the U.S. economy may well be
back on a path that looks much like that of the late 2010s
– slow growth, low inflation, moderate interest rates and
strong corporate margins.  it is an environment that could be very
positive for financial markets.

#### Three forces, in particular, will put downward pressure on GDP growth.
* First, consumer spending will be hit by the lagged effects
of fading fiscal stimulus.
* Second, both home building and home buying are
falling sharply due to a more than doubling of mortgage
rates since the start of the year.
* Third, both slower growth overseas and a high dollar
should hurt international trade in the year ahead.

* payroll job growth positive into 2023 and limit any increase in the
unemployment rate in 2023.
* Inflation pressures are continuing to fade


## Fixed Income: A “pivot”-al year for the Fed
* The Fed is widely expected to enter the final inning of its
rate hiking cycle in 1Q23.
*  25bps increases in February and March
* All things considered, the upside risk the Fed hikes
too much is limited,

### Credit outlook
* With investment-grade (IG) and high-yield (HY) corporate
bonds yielding close to 6% and 9%, respectively
*  credit spreads have not widened enough, particularly for low-quality
bonds, to compensate for the rising risk of default amid
a rising economic backdrop next year
*  credit spreads have not widened enough, in previous non-recession
market corrections, IG and HY spreads peaked at
roughly 250bps and 850bps, 

### Liquidity conditions
* Treasury market is less liquid
than in previous years, it is not so unusually illiquid as to
warrant concern.
* Though not an immediate issue, lower-than-normal liquidity could
lead to continued fixed income volatility in 2023.

### Investment implications
* An overweight to IG bonds seems appropriate relative to HY.
* Investors should take advantage of yields in short-dated bonds, while
increasing exposure to long-dated bonds which should
benefit from declining yields driven by falling inflation
and real growth.
* Rate cuts will likely have to wait until 2024
(with the exception of some emerging markets, like some
in Latin America)
* Rate hikes should end as the second
quarter of the year begins (with the exception of Japan
* China follows its own economic, policy and
political cycles separate from the rest of the world.
* As the rest of the world decelerates, China may finally pick up a bit of steam

*  the U.S. dollar was up 9% year-over-year by the
end of November to its highest level, in real terms,
since 1985.  it may be delayed until rate differentials stabilize
convincingly and global economic growth surprises
turn less negative. 

## Equities

### U.S. equities: Three questions for 2023
* * The US economy, and the US consumer, have been defying expectations. US consumer spending continued to support real GDP growth despite the dual headwinds of rising interest rates and high inflation.
* if a recession can be avoided, we
would expect earnings to be roughly flat relative to 2022
levels. 
*  if the U.S. economy falls into recession,
history suggests earnings could decline by as much as
15%–20%.
* We have seen peak
inflation, peak Fed hawkishness and (hopefully) peak
geopolitical tensions, but these issues have not gone
away and will remain as a source of volatility. 
* In fact, since 1960, the
S&P 500 has bottomed an average of 6 months before
the unemployment rate has peaked.

### International equities: 

### China
* Chinese equities (and hence broader
emerging markets) have the potential to be the first
to turn in the right direction. 
* It is key for investors to invest in the “new new
China” by focusing especially on A-shares, which grant
exposure to the priority areas of business technology,
domestic demand and the energy transition

#### Europe
* Europe where consensus still looks for 0% earnings
growth amidst a likely recession)
* In contrast, every other major region now has valuations
significantly below their long-term averages, especially
Japan (-35%), Europe (-18%) and China (-15%).
*  the valuation discount of international equities
to U.S. markets is now at -30%,
* Historically, investors have been rewarded
for investing when confidence is already depressed
due to cyclical considerations. 
* Luxury goods companies listed in Europe
that derive the majority of their revenue from emerging
consumers. 
* * Large parts of Europe have likely entered into recession as of Q4 2022

## Emerging Markets

## Alternatives
*  Looking across real assets more broadly, infrastructure can
help hedge against inflation, and transportation assets
should benefit as global trade continues to normalize.
* a two- to three-quarter lag between public equity market drawdowns and markdowns
of private equity assets.
