# INTRODUCTION
> No one I know draws that way because it is difficult to keep such a jumble of instructions in mind while drawing.

> `Keys to Drawing` essentially is learning to trust our eyes and learning different ways in which we can reinforce that trust.

> Drawing is primarily a process of seeing rather than strictly an application of principles.

> In addition to trusting our eyes, the quality that most defines any of us as artists is curiosity.
